## SLR
SLR is a Student Life Raft available for college students. This is a free application avaiable to any student who needs help with a specific subject in exchange for providing help for another student.

### **Step by Step instructions**

1. Navigate to our page at: https://student-life-raft.herokuapp.com

2. Upon load, the user is prompted to sign in or sign up.  If this is the first time the user is using the app, they will sign up (first name, last name, email address, password).  After signing up, the user will automatically be redirected to the home page.

3. If you're a returning user, you press sign in and log in with username/password, and you will be directed to the home page.

4. On the home page, the sidebar will show the username, and the left side shows the dashboard.  From here, the user can see recent posts, posts in progress, completed posts or create a post.

5. When a user creates a post, they select a specific subject, and input a message of what task they would like to have done, and it will be post it.  

6. From here, another user can see the post and accept it, and the current user can accept other posts.
